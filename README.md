    Employment timeline (Hire Date, Termination Date)

    Derived fields (Hire/Termination Year, Month, Quarter)
    
Key Insights
1. Workforce Demographics

    Gender Split:

        Male: 11,288 (51%)

        Female: 10,321 (46%)

        Non-Conforming: 605 (3%)

    Race & Diversity:

    Accounting: 3,333

    Sales: 1,832

    Human Resources: 1,807

    Training: 1,692

Engineering and Accounting dominate in headcount, suggesting a tech- and finance-heavy workforce.
3. Hiring Trends

    Consistent hiring activity is observed from 2001 to 2020.

    Hiring peaks occurred in 2001, 2016, and 2018–2019, signaling organizational growth phases.

    Most hires occur in Q1 and Q2, likely aligning with fiscal planning cycles.

4. Attrition Analysis

    A total of 3,929 terminations (approx. 18%) are recorded.

    Termination volume rose steadily from 2010, peaking between 2020 and 2025.

    This upward trend may reflect scaling, restructuring, or external factors such as economic shifts or policy changes.

5. Tenure & Lifecycle Patterns

    A significant portion of employees hired before 2010 are still active, indicating long-tenured staff.

    Attrition is concentrated among mid-tenure staff (5–10 years), especially in Sales, Support, and Training roles.
